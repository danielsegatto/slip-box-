# slip-box

Slip-box is a generation thinking tool built upon the Atomicity Manifesto. Unlike traditional note-taking apps that rely on rigid folders and hierarchies, Slip-box emulates human cognition through organic connections, zero-friction capture, and non-linear growth.

"When a user opens the app, they should see their thoughts reflected back at them without the clutter of traditional file systems."

## Atomicity Manifesto Principles 
This project is guided by five core pillars:
- The Atomicity Principle: A note is not a document; it is a single, irreducible thought. If a note contains two ideas, it must be split.
- The Freedom of Anonymity (Title-less Design): Titles are a cognitive tax. By removing them, Slip-box creates a "Direct Entry" experience where the content is the only thing that matters.
- The Primacy of Connection: In a Slip-box, an isolated note is a dead note. Value resides in the density and quality of the connections between ideas.
- Non-Linear Growth, Linear Retrieval: While the "brain" of the app is a chaotic web, the human mind follows threads. Anterior and posterior links allow users to pull a linear string of thought out of a non-linear mess.
- Minimalism as Mental Space: Every unnecessary UI element is a distraction. The interface is a quiet, empty room where only the current thought exists.
